Hey! Kraken4037 here, i have created the .lnxu/.lnxa/.lnxe extensions so i can easily open them up in Linux Ubuntu. What, scared of Linux? Yeah, i know you sensitive prick, "EUHHH WINDOWS IS SO GOOD ITS BETTER THAN LINUX!" -typical soft boy lol


Anyyyyyways, you need BitBerryFileOpener to open the files lol, enjoy the stuff i put in.


For some more info: The .lnxu/.lnxa/.lnxe are file types that hold linux files, such as images, audio, scripts, and even 3D models.
